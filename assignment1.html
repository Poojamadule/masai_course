        <h1>b tag</h1>
        <p>The HTML b tag is used to create a 'b' element, which represents bold text in an HTML document. The b tag should be used to markup text as bold without conveying any extra importance, for example in article abstracts, where the beginning of an article is set in bold text.</p>
     <h1>i tag</h1>
    <p>The i tag defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. The i tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.</p>
    <h1> u tag</h1>
<p>u The Unarticulated Annotation (Underline) element. The u HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS</p>
<h1>select tag</h1>
<p>The select element is used to create a drop-down list. The select element is most often used in a form, to collect user input. The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute, no data from the drop-down list will be submitted).</p>
<h1>button tag</h1>
<p> The button tag defines a clickable button. Inside a  element you can put text (and tags like i , b , strong , br , img> , etc.). That is not possible with a button created with the input element!</p>
<h1>hr tag</h1>

<h1>br tag</h1>
<p> The Line Break element. The  HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return).</p></body>
